# I’m Not a Problem Solver. I’m a Professional Fire Starter.

Let’s be honest: solving a problem is just logic. Any LLM can do that. Any LLM can put out a fire. But _starting the fire_? Identifying a crisis that requires a cross-functional task force, and a 20-page architectural roadmap? That takes **vision**.

## The Era of the Universal Solver

We live in the age of AI. Everyone is a "solver" now. You have a bug? You feed a prompt to a model, and it gives you a solution. Need a script? Ask an LLM.

Solving is becoming a commodity. It’s fast, it’s efficient, and it’s increasingly automated.

But can an AI do what I do?

- Can an AI **identify the "invisible" systemic risk of legacy observability** and convince leadership that a multi-phase OpenTelemetry migration is the only path to scalability?
- Can an AI **define the "existential requirement" for vendor-neutral data enrichment** and then architect the multi-phase strategy to standardize the entire organization?
- Can an AI **present a "visionary" 30% reduction in telemetry volume** that makes me look like a budget-saving performance-conscious wizard, while simultaneously slashing developer inner-loop times?

No. That is human craftsmanship. That is _crisis management_.

## The Human Advantage

AI can find the shortest path from A to B. But I? I will show you why the path you’re on is leading to a cliff, set the cliff on fire just to be sure, and then build you a bridge you never knew you needed.
