# I’m Not a Problem Solver. I’m a Professional Fire Starter.

Let’s be honest: solving a problem is just logic. If you give an LLM enough context and a clear error message, it’ll give you a fix. Boring. Any machine can put out a fire. But _identifying_ the crisis that requires a cross-functional task force, a dedicated Teams team, and an architectural roadmap? That takes **vision**.

## The Era of the Universal Solver

We live in the age of AI. Everyone is a "solver" now. You have a bug? You feed a prompt to a model, and it gives you a solution. Need a script? Ask an LLM.

Solving is becoming a commodity. It’s fast, it’s efficient, and it’s increasingly automated. If our entire value proposition is "I can fix things," we’re essentially competing with a very fast, very polite autocomplete.

But can an AI do what I do?

- Can an AI **sniff out the "invisible" systemic risk** of legacy observability and then convince leadership that a multi-phase OpenTelemetry migration is the only thing standing between us and total digital collapse?
- Can an AI **manufacture the "existential requirement"** for vendor-neutral data enrichment and then architect a strategy so complex it makes "standardization" sound like a religious experience?
- Can an AI **orchestrate a "visionary" 30% reduction in telemetry volume** that makes me look like a budget-saving, performance-conscious wizard, while simultaneously slashing developer inner-loop times?

No. That is human craftsmanship. That is _strategic arson_.

## The Human Advantage

AI can find the shortest path from A to B. But I? I will show you why the path you’re on is leading to a cliff, set the cliff on fire just to be sure, and then build you a bridge you never knew you needed.

In a world full of fire extinguishers, be the spark. (Just make sure you have the bridge-building budget/support approved first.)
