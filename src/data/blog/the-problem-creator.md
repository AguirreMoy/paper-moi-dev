# I’m Not a Problem Solver. I’m a Professional Fire Starter.

In every performance cycle, every retro, and every sync meant to "integrate continuous feedback loops for team alignment," I look my manager dead in the eye and deliver the ultimate industry cliché: **"I am a relentless problem solver."**

I say it with such conviction—brows furrowed, nodding slowly—that they usually miss the fine print. Because while it’s true that I can navigate a stack trace like a noir detective in a rain-soaked alley, my real, God-given talent—the one that truly separates the Seniors from the Juniors—is my ability to manifest a high-stakes crisis out of thin air.

Let’s be honest: solving a problem is just logic. Any LLM can do that. But *starting the fire*? Identifying a crisis so complex it requires three months of "strategic alignment," a cross-functional task force, and a 20-page architectural roadmap? That takes **vision**.

## The Era of the Universal Solver

We live in the age of AI. Everyone is a "solver" now. You have a bug? You feed a prompt to a model, and it gives you a solution. Need a script? Ask an LLM.

Solving is becoming a commodity. It’s fast, it’s efficient, and it’s increasingly automated.

But can an AI do what I do?

- Can an AI **spark an "existential" debate about the systemic risk of legacy observability** and convince leadership that a multi-year OpenTelemetry migration is the only path to survival?
- (Especially when that "crisis" was just a system I hadn't finished reading the README for yet?)
- Can an AI **ignite the "urgent requirement" for vendor-neutral data enrichment** and then heroically architect the 50-page strategy to standardize the entire organization?
- Can an AI **heroically extinguish the very flames I fanned** by presenting a 30% reduction in telemetry volume that makes me look like a budget-saving wizard?

No. That is human craftsmanship. That is *crisis management*.

## The Human Advantage

To my current and future managers: You should hire me for my solutions, but you’ll keep me for my innovative disasters. I am a self-sustaining ecosystem of technical debt. I create the fire, I marvel at the structural integrity of the flames, and then I heroically put it out.

It’s called full-cycle development. Look it up.
