Watching Donovan Carrillo’s performance today was a powerful reminder that excellence isn't reserved for those with the most resources. He reached the Olympic stage after years of practicing at a local shopping mall rink, proving that grit can bridge the gap when you don't have the latest or greatest facilities. As a Latino who didn’t always have access to the best tools, seeing him compete at this level is deeply personal for me.

While I’ve moved beyond my own "mall rink" and now have access to much better resources, Donovan's story is a vital reminder to never lose that scrappy mindset. It’s not about waiting for perfect conditions; it’s about the relentless drive to execute and evolve regardless of where you start. I’m focused on continuing to make my mark, leveraging everything I’ve built to reach the next level of excellence.
